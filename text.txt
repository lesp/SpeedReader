In this project we use Sonic Pi and its powerful Ruby language to create a treasure hunt game which includes music. Using Sonic Pi live_loops we can learn how to run many different “threads” of activities  that will check the location of the player, animate sections of the game and produce music based on location. The players location is handled via X,Y,Z coordinates which are used in Minecraft to construct the world in three dimensions. The players current location is always displayed in the top left of the screen.
